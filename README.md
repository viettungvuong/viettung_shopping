## How to run locally

To run this project locally, you open the project with VSCode or IntellijIDEA and then try on an emulator. You can also download the [apk](https://github.com/viettungvuong/viettung_shopping/releases/tag/release) and install on an Android device. 

Since I do not have a credit card, I cannot host my application on Heroku. I apologize for the inconvennience.
